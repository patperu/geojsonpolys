## Installation

Dev version

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("ropenscilabs/geojsonpolys")
```

```{r}
library("geojsonpolys")
```

## Get you some geojson

There's two datasets in the package so far. 

One `counties_us` is a character vector of GeoJSON for each county in the US. For example:

```{r}
counties_us[1]
```

Another is a data.frame with the GeoJSON but also with metadata for states and counties, which
can make it easier to pick out the GeoJSON you want. (if you load `tibble` you get a brief data.frame 
output)

```{r}
library(tibble)
counties_us_df
```

Multnomah is a county in Oregon that contains Portland

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(geojsonio)

```
